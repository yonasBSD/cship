## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- Added `cship.peak_usage` module — shows a configurable peak-time indicator during Anthropic's high-load hours (Mon–Fri 07:00–17:00 US Pacific by default), with zero new dependencies ([@timoklein](https://github.com/timoklein))

### Fixed
- Fixed upgrade via re-running the install script — now runs `cship uninstall` first to remove stale binaries from all locations (e.g. `~/.cargo/bin`) before installing the latest release
- Fixed clippy warnings in `explain.rs` and `cli.rs` tests ([@nh13](https://github.com/nh13))

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-28

- Added `{remaining}` placeholder to usage limits format strings ([@tkm3d1a](https://github.com/tkm3d1a))
- Added ability to read `rate_limits` from Claude Code stdin before falling back to the OAuth API ([@0xRaduan](https://github.com/0xRaduan))
